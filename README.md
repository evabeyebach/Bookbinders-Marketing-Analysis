# Bookbinders-Marketing-Analysis
We used multiple predictive modeling techniques to forecast customer responses to marketing initiatives.

## Background
This case study explores the strategic and operational challenges Bookbinders Book Club (BBBC) faces amid the shifting dynamics of book retail and distribution since its establishment in 
1986. With the rise of superstores and online retailing altering consumer preferences and intensifying competitive pressures, BBBC has been prompted to innovate its customer
engagement and sales strategies. Utilizing a robust database of 500,000 readers, BBBC is advancing into database marketing and predictive modeling to boost the efficiency of its direct
marketing techniques.






## Introduction
BBBC wants to determine which predictive model is best at improving the efficacy of direct mail programs. Their last model, which consisted of 20,000 customers across 
Northeastern USA that received a copy of the mailing list and a brochure for The History of Florence. Of the 20,000 clients that received the  mailing list, 9.03% purchased the book.

**BBBC wants to maximize the number of clients that buy the book**, and is exploring 3 models that may allow it to do so: linear regression, logistic regression, and SVM.
